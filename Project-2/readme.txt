Dumb Players:
	Travel in straight lines in random directions only. They can get stuck in rooms.

Smart Player:

	Scarlet is allowed to zig-zag squares as opposed to being forced to travel in a straight line. Never enters rooms except for the door. In the case that the only room left for her to observe is the only one that will do her good, she enters the room stopping on the door. Then the next turn she exits the room in a straight line and random direction. Following the turn that brings her out of the room, she zig-zags back to the room.
